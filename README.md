This is a demo project for building a well tested API in Go using TDD. This example showcases the following:
* Test coverage of http routers and handlers
* Test coverage of DB Repositories
* Test coverage of DB connection code
* Running DB migrations (both forwards and backwards) as part of tests
* Data fixtures setup and teardown on each integration test
